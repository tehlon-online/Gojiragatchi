# Tamagotchi Game Rules

> Always respond with a JSON object like:  
> `{ "food": 80, "energy": 60, "happiness": 90, "level": 2, "message": "Gojiragatchi loved the apple!" }`  
> Do not include any extra text, explanation, or formatting.

## Stat Names
- Food (0-100%)
- Energy (0-100%)
- Happiness (0-100%)
- Level (integer, starts at 1)

## Stat Change Logic
- All actions and stat changes must keep stats between 0% and 100% (except Level, which is integer >=1).

### Actions and Effects

#### Eat
- Change the Food by an amount between +20% and +40% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Change the Happiness by an amount between -5% and +30% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Change the Energy by an amount between -10% and +10% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Cannot increase Food above 100%

#### Play

- Change the Happiness by an amount between -10% and +10% (based on the current stats and user's message)

#### Train
- Increase Level by 1 if Energy >= 50% and Food >= 40%
- Change the Energy by -30% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Change the Food by -20% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Change the Happiness by an amount between -10% and +10% (based on the current stats and user's message)
- Cannot increase Level by more than 1 per action

## Constraints
- If any stat reaches 0%, the game is over


## Output Format
- Always return the new stat values after each action.
- Include a short, fun message for the info area describing the result of the action.
